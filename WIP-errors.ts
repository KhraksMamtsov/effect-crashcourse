/*
 * Effect (and ZIO) have 3 main types of errors:
 *
 * 1) Failure
 * Generated using Z.fail and appears in the E type of Effect<R,E,A> (which is
 * also known as the failure channel).
 *
 * These are also called 'expected errors' or 'typed errors' in ZIO,
 * or 'recoverable errors' in the Effect docs.
 *
 * They are errors which the developer expects to happen, part of the domain,
 * and part of the program's control flow.
 *
 * In spirit they are similar to checked exceptions.
 *
 * 2) Defect
 * Generated using Z.die, they don't appear in the Effect<R,E,A> type.
 *
 * Also known as 'unexpected errors' or 'untyped errors' in ZIO, or
 * 'unrecoverable errors' in the Effect docs. (NOTE: despite the name there
 * are ways to recover from them but it's way more verbose compared to failures).
 *
 * These are unexpected errors which are not part of the domain, nor the
 * control flow.
 *
 * While it doesn't appear in the type Effect<R,E,A>, the Effect runtime keeps
 * track of these errors in a data structure called Cause (more on this later),
 * and there are combinators that allow to access the Cause and analyze it.
 *
 * In spirit, similar to unchecked exceptions.
 *
 * 3) Interruption
 * Generated with Effect.interrupt to interrupt the executing Fiber, or
 * Fiber.interrupt(fiber) to interrupt `fiber`.
 *
 * An interruption will cause the fiber to return an Exit.Failure containing
 * a Cause.interrupt. Will go more in depth in the Fiber chapters.

/* Building Errors
 * ===============
 *
 * Until now we used string literals in the failure channel of the example
 * effects we built. That was mainly for readability and to not introduce all
 * the concepts at one.
 *
 * In reality it's better to fail with an object that has a _tag field.
 * The reason being Effect comes with a few combinators built specifically to
 * handle such error objects in a typesafe way.
 *
 * You can use either Data.Case or Typescript Classes to define such error
 * types. i.e.:
 */

export interface FooError extends Data.Case {
  readonly _tag: "FooError";
  readonly error: string;
}

export class BarError {
  readonly _tag = "BarError";
  constructor(readonly error: string) {}
}

export class BazError {
  readonly _tag = "BazError";
  constructor(readonly error: string) {}
}

/*
 * As you can probably tell, classes are way more concise, but Data.Case has
 * the added benefit of providing an Equal implementation.
 *
 * That allows to compare errors by value instead of reference.
 */

// This is true because the argument to FooError is compared by value
export const isEqual = Equal.equals(

// This is not true, foo1 and foo2 are different!
export const isNotEqual = Equal.equals(
  FooError({ error: "foo1" }),
  FooError({ error: "foo2" }),

/*
 * NOTE: Aside from Data.Case, Data also has a few other handy data structures
 * to perform comparison by value: Data.struct, Data.tuple, Data.array.
